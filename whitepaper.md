# Terminus white paper

Terminus is a decentralized authorization mechanism for web3. It is represented by a single EIP1155
smart contract.

Decentralized projects create pools of authorization tokens on the Terminus contract. Each pool represents
a set of permissions that its tokens impart to their bearers. Software can validate through these tokens
whether a person controlling a given address has the permissions required to use its functionality.

Terminus tokens are battle-tested and gas-optimized, and are the easiest, most secure, and most cost-effective
way for decentralized projects to add authorization into their protocols.

Terminus creates an open market for permissions that has not existed until today. This market provides
valuable feedback to projects about their adoption and utility. It gives market participants fair and
liquid access to decentralized projects.
