# Terminus white paper

Terminus is a decentralized authorization mechanism for web3. It is represented by a single [EIP1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)
smart contract.

Decentralized projects create pools of authorization tokens on the Terminus contract. Each pool represents
a set of permissions that its tokens impart to their bearers. Software can validate through these tokens
whether a person controlling a given address has the permissions required to use its functionality.

Terminus comes with a completely free and open source dashboard and command line tool. Individuals
and decentralized projects can use these tools to manage their authorizations and authorization pools.

Terminus tokens are battle-tested and gas-optimized. They are the easiest, most secure, and most cost-effective
way for decentralized projects to add authorization into their protocols.

Terminus creates an open market for permissions that has not existed until today. This market provides
valuable feedback to projects about their adoption and utility. It gives market participants fair and
liquid access to decentralized projects.

## The state of authorization in decentralized projects

Different types of decentralized projects currently adopt different techniques to authorize their
members and their users. This section describes some of these techniques.
